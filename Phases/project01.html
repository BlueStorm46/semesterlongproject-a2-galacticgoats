      <h2 class="name">Project Description</h2>
      <p>We all like pretty pictures. They are attractive and shiny and let you show off.
         Fractals are doubly cool: not only do fractals make pretty pictures, but they are pretty pictures that let you show off your
         programming skills. As an added bonus, there is <a
         href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101227125633/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/mp3/Mandelbrot%20Set.mp3">geeky,
            but kinda cool, music</a> about them. As a <a href="http://www.threadbombing.com/data/media/31/OMFG.jpg">gentle
            introduction</a> to real-world programming practices, this term has you developing a program that can generate,
         display, and save fractals images. By the end of the term, your
         programs will be able to produce images like these:
      </p> <img alt="Pretty picture of the Mandelbrot set" src="mandelbrot.png" /> <img
         alt="Pretty picture of the Julia set" src="julia.png" /> <img
         alt="Hertz's favorite picture, but why are you reading this?" src="burning_ship.png" />
         <img
         alt="Really, I want to know -- why are you reading this?" src="multibrot.png" />
      <p>To reflect real-world practices, the project is broken up into 4 three-week-long phases (called <a
         href="http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-sprint/">&quot;sprints&quot;</a> in agile development). When this first
         phase ends, your team will have developed a comprehensive set of unit tests validating you can correctly calculate the fractals and the code doing the calculation.
         Future phases have your team creating and then refining a GUI application which displays and
         manipulates these fractals. While work is due at the end of each phase, you should remember that the project
         continues until the end of the term. Writing code that works only for the current phase may be quicker in the
         short-term, a little planning and design will be much faster in the end. As is often said: <span
         style="text-align: center; text-shadow: gray; color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;"> Hours
            of coding makes up for minutes of planning</span>.

      <div class="section">
      <a name="cloning"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Creating the repository</h2>
      <p>Your team will need to use a github repository to share code. In addition to giving you experience with common
      real-world team development tools, the projects will be linked in the CSE116 classroom. This enables the course staff
      (e.g., instructors &amp; TAs) to help teams resolve problems as they occur. These instructions are available as
      a pinned announcement in the course Piazza site or <a href="github_instructions.html">on this page</a>.</p>

      <a name="rules"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Escape-Time Algorithms</h2>
      <p>The fractals your program will be generating this term are all &quot;escape-time algorithms&quot;.
         Escape-time algorithms imagine the picture is a Cartesian plane (I had to look this up, too -- it means point
         is defined by its x- and y-coordinates). Each <span class="highlight">PIXEL</span> (point on this plane) is
         then colored using the following process:
      </p>
      <pre>
      Set <span class="variable">xCalc</span> = current point's x-coordinate
      Set <span class="variable">yCalc</span> = current point's y-coordinate
      Set <span class="variable">dist</span> = distance from the point (<span class="variable">xCalc</span>, <span
            class="variable">yCalc</span>) to (0,0) using the Pythagorean theorem
      Set <span class="variable">passes</span> = 0
      While <span class="variable">dist</span> &le; 2 and <span class="variable">passes</span> &lt; 255 do
        Update <span class="variable">xCalc</span> and <span class="variable">yCalc</span> using the update function defined for the fractal being generated
        Increase <span class="variable">passes</span> by 1
        Set <span class="variable">dist</span> = distance from the point (<span class="variable">xCalc</span>, <span
            class="variable">yCalc</span>) to (0,0) using the Pythagorean theorem
      EndWhile
      Set the current point's escape-time equal to <span class="variable">passes</span>
      </pre>
      <p>Note that there is nothing special about the numbers 2 and 255 in the above algorithm; any positive numbers
         could instead be used. The number 2 is the &quot;escape distance&quot; (the distance above which we expect the
         series will eventually reach infinity) and the number 255 determines the maximum number of steps that will be
         considered. Replacing these with other numbers does not change the fractal definition, just how it is visualized. Future phases may
         (or may not) change what these values will be.</p>
      <p>The range of x- and y-coordinates to use is specific to each fractal. These ranges are stated below (just after the fractal's update function).
         They are not important, but were selected because
         they make for pretty pictures. It is also possible that these could be changed.
         For this first phase, you will need to
         split the ranges into 512 equally-spaced rows and 512 equally-spaced columns. To generate the entire fractal, you simply calculate
         the escape-time for each of these 262144 coordinate pairs. (The number 262144 is equal to 512 * 512 or the number of
         row &amp; column combination). The final fractal results should be returned as a 2-d array on <span
         class="code">int</span>.

      <a name="requirements"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Phase #1 Requirements</h2>
      <p><b>It is important that each group follow these requirements.</b> In keeping with an iterative development
         model, this first phase is limited to calculating the escape-times for each fractal. Future phases will add
         features. Some of these features may require modifying assumptions from this phase. While good designs will easily adapt to these changes,
         groups that do not spend time and thinking through their project's design will find that
         future phases require major rewrites. Remember: <span style="text-shadow: gray; color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">hours
            of coding makes up for minutes of planning</span>.
      <p><span style="text-align: center; text-shadow: gray; color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: xx-large;">You
            must ABSOLUTELY NOT create ANY KIND of user interface for phase 1.</span> Since the fractal generation code is
         critical for future phases, this phase focuses on developing (and passing) a solid set of JUnit test cases
         which verify your fractal generation code works. The JUnit tests listed in the <a href="#rubric">phase
            grading rubric</a> are the minimum set of test cases you should be writing.</p>

      <h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
      <p>In proper test-driven development, JUnit tests are <a
         href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/executableSpecifications.htm">executable specifications</a> and are written <i>prior</i>
         to the implementation code. While this can be difficult at first, practice helps TDD become
         second nature AND helps you write better code AND reduces the total programming time needed.
         Plus, would you rather struggle now or in your first job or internship?
      </p>
      <p>To &quot;help&quot; you get this practice, course staff will only review JUnit tests and the code executed
         by the JUnit. <b>NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>Collective Ownership</h3>
      <p>Most organizations using agile development also practice <a
         href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/collective-ownership/">Collective Ownership</a>. This concept
         means that the ENTIRE team has the right to change any document, but also that the ENTIRE team is responsible
         for EVERY mistake.
      </p>
      <p>To give you practice with this concept, each team is required to <span class="highlight">create and
            use a Git repository for their project on github</span>. Recitation TAs will help you start this process, but you
         can refer back to these tutorials:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6760115/importing-a-github-project-into-eclipse/19065354#19065354">Importing
               a github repository into Eclipse</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/tutorials/egit-tutorial/">Starting with EGit in Eclipse</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html">Git version control with
               Eclipse (EGit)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Code Standards</h3>
      <p>Every programmer has their preferred way to format code and <a
         href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/death-to-the-space-infidels/">believes it to be superior to all others</a>.
         Every programmer is wrong (except me). To avoid fights, companies and open-source projects set specific
         standards that must be followed. For this project, your team's code MUST meet the following standards:
      <dl>
         <dt>Package naming</dt>
         <dd>None of your classes may be in the default package. You must at least one package for your code (named
            <tt>code</tt> ) and another package for your JUnit tests (named <tt>tests</tt> ). You <i>should</i> use
            sub-packages within these packages to help you organize your code. If it helps structure your program, you
            can create even more packages.
         </dd>

         <dt><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/if-it-isnt-documented-it-doesnt-exist/">Code Comments</a></dt>
         <dd>All classes, methods, and fields in your implementation (non-JUnit test) code needs to be documented
            using Javadoc. See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc
               Technology page</a> for more information. In particular, consider reviewing <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html">this page on how to write comments
               in Javadoc</a>.
         </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Communication and Documentation</h3>
      <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams">Communication quality is the
            best predictor</a> of whether a project will succeed or fail. This includes communication:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>between the development team and the customer (your team should use Piazza to ask the TAs and I
            questions you have)</li>
         <li>between team members about their plans (this should be done in the meeting minutes stored in the
            team's github repository)</li>
         <li>between developers about what each method must do (JUnit tests accomplish this)</li>
      </ul>
      Your TAs and the instructor can help answer questions you have about how to use Piazza and Git.

      <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2012/july/doing-agile-with-pairing">Pair
            programming</a> is a core tenet of agile software development. The Agile Alliance even <a
         href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html">includes a section</a> with suggestions for how to
         improve your pair programming skills. For those looking for even more help, YouTube also has some excellent
         videos:
      <ul>
         <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET3Q6zNK3Io">Agile in Practice: Pair Programming</a></li>
         <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_U12uqRhE">Introduction to Pair Programming, version 2</a></li>
      </ul>
      To demonstrate how important pair programming is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6MnEZlW7pU">some
         companies include pair programming in job interviews</a>.
   </div>
   <div class="section">
      <a name="teams"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Teamwork guidelines</h2>
      <p>It is important that there is a roughly equal division of labor amongst teammates. It is completely
         unacceptable for one person to do most of the work. At the end of each phase, points will be split up between
         teammates based upon how much of the work they were reported to have done. It is therefore important for each
         person to do their fair share.</p>
      <p>If you are having trouble with an unmotivated group member you should seek to solve the problem at the
         group level first. If this does not work, you must seek the aid of your recitation TA. If this does not work,
         your recitation TA can have you talk to the course instructor.</p>

      <h3>Meeting Minutes</h3>

      <p>Never attend a meeting that does not have an agenda. <a
         href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-run-a-meeting/">It will only waste your time</a>. A meeting that
         does not have minutes is also a waste; any decisions will be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>Your team MUST meet during your recitation section. This meeting will occur after the TAs presentation and
         should plan out your next week's work. To make certain this time is not wasted, you MUST use the following
         template to record minutes from each meeting. (This format also doubles as the agenda for your next meeting).
         You can find a template in your group's <span class="code">MeetingMinutes</span> folder in the repository. You
         may organize your minutes in this folder in whatever way works best for your group. Taking minutes requires
         effort and this should be considered when balancing workloads among members.
      </p>
      <p>Meeting Minutes for _______________:</p>
      <ul>

               must show the TA your completed minutes if you want to leave the recitation early.</b> Recitations are the
            only guaranteed time your team will be together and should not be wasted.</li>
         <li>Be open to compromise.</li>
         <li>Do NOT exclude team members. An important part of teamwork is learning how to maximize member's
            strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. Pairing stronger and weaker coders has been shown to help both
            students learn more and produce better results than if each were to work by themselves.</li>
         <li><b><i>POLITELY</i></b> discuss problems as soon as they arise. Problems only become bigger and harder
            to solve the longer they last. If your team cannot resolve a problem, talk to the TA. If the problem still
            cannot be resolved, talk to the instructor. A lingering dispute is not an acceptable excuse for submitting
            work late.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team peer-evaluation mechanism</h3>
      <p>The project submission for a team is graded as a whole, but each team member receives an individual grade
         which is based on that submission grade and the peer evaluations received from their teammates. The peer
         evaluation will be done via an on-line survey. Instructions for completing the on-line survey will be provided
         at the end of each phase.</p>

      <h2 class="name">How to Submit</h2>
      <p>Phase #1 can only be submitted by the team member whose username comes first alphabetically. Submission by
         other students will not be accepted nor can they be used to show that work was completed before the submission
         deadline. We <b>strongly</b> encourage each team schedule a meeting which includes all members to do the
         Web-CAT submission.
      </p>
      <p>The project submission must contain the entire Eclipse project including the properly Javadoc'd source
         code. This includes both the implementation code AND the JUnit test code.</p>

      <h2 class="name">Phase #1 Grading Rubric</h2>
      <p>The team grades for phase #1 will use the following rubric:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Each team must write JUnit tests showing that their project can: [98 points]
            <ul>
               <li>Translate a pixel's row to the associated x-coordinate in the fractal (1 test per fractal) [4 *
                  5 points = 20 points]</li>
               <li>Translate a pixel's column to the associated y-coordinate in the fractal (1 test per fractal) [4
                  * 5 points = 20 points]</li>
               <li>Calculates the escape time for a coordinate whose distance from the origin never
                  exceeds the escape distance [4 * 6 points = 24 points]
