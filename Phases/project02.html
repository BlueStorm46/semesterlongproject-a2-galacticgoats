      <h2 class="name">Phase Description</h2>
      <p>Pretty pictures are not very pretty if they cannot be seen. So <span class="highlight">this phase is
            all about the GUI</span>. To start, you should <a href="FractalPanel.jar">download this JAR file</a>. It contains a
         single class, <span class="code">FractalPanel</span>. <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> is a subclass of <span
         class="code">JPanel</span> that adds 2 methods which, when combined, display a fractal. The first method is <a
         href="doc/edu/buffalo/fractal/FractalPanel.html#updateImage-int:A:A-" class="code">updateImage()</a>. This
         method takes in your 2-d array of <span class="code">int</span> with the calculated escape time for each pixel.
         This is the fractal that will then be drawn in the panel. It does this by using the value that was previously
         provided by a second method: <a
         href="doc/edu/buffalo/fractal/FractalPanel.html#setIndexColorModel-java.awt.image.IndexColorModel-"
         class="code">setIndexColorModel()</a>. This second method specifies the color scheme that is used to draw the
         fractal. It takes in an instance of <a
         href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/image/IndexColorModel.html" class="code">IndexColorModel</a>
         which defines a set of colors. For each entry in the array, the <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> uses the
         escape time to find the color at that index in the <a
         href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/image/IndexColorModel.html" class="code">IndexColorModel</a>.
         That color is used to draw that pixel.The <a href="doc/index.html">details of the <span class="code">FractalPanel</span>
            class are documented here
      </a>.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone has a different idea of what colors make the fractals most attractive. Rather than force my
         (objectively better) design choices, each group must define 4 different color models for users to choose from.
         To get you started you can (but do not have to) <a href="ColorModelFactory.java">use this class which has 3
            methods which create color models</a>. Even with this, you will need to create a color model on your own. My
         only request is that groups <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">do not create
            color schemes that blind the user or give them a migraine</span>.
      <p>We also need something which will let the user choose from the four fractal algorithms and four color
         schemes should be used. <span class="highlight">Give your program <a
            href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c6/s7.html#GUI1.8.1">a menubar with <i>at least</i> 3 menus
         </a>: File, Fractal, and Color.
      </span> The File menu should contain an <span class="highlight">option to quit the program</span>, the Fractal menu
         should contain <span class="highlight">menu items for each fractal</span>, and the Color menu should contain <span
         class="highlight">menu items for each of your color schemes</span>. When the Exit item is selected, your
         program should quit. When a fractal is selected, you should calculate the fractal and display it using the most
         recently selected color scheme. When a color scheme is selected, you should set it so that fractals will be
         displayed using this color scheme until a different choice is made or the program exits.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the last phase relied on an escape distance of 2. <span class="highlight">Provide the user
            with some method of changing to a new escape distance</span>. Your program must either prevent users from entering
         an invalid escape distance OR show an error when the escape distance they enter is not a number greater then 0.
         If the user provides an escape distance greater than 0, recalculate the last chosen fractal and have the <span
         class="code">FractalPanel</span> display the recalculated escape times.
      <p>Remember, <span style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">hours
            of coding makes up for minutes of planning</span>.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
      <a name="recitation"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Recitation Activity for Week of Mar. 5 - Mar. 11</h2>
      <p>The second week of the phase will not have a traditional recitation activity. Instead, students will have
         nearly the full 110 minutes to work in their groups on this phase. During this time the TAs will be talking to
         each group about their plans for this phase. In particular, <span class="highlight">each group will
            explain how their program will handle the user providing a new escape distance</span>. While code is not required,
         <span class="highlight">explanations should state what classes are involved and what variables/instance
            variables will be used to call methods in that class. You do not need to show any code, but we want to see
            you have planned out how this will be done. </span>. Grades for the recitation will be assigned using the following
         rubric:

      <p>Phase #2 can only be submitted by the team member whose username comes first alphabetically. Submission by
         other students will not be accepted nor can they be used to show that work was completed before the submission
         deadline. We <b>strongly</b> encourage each team schedule a meeting which includes all members to do the
         Web-CAT submission. <span class="highlight">Any students not included in the list of 
            submission group members will receive a 0.</span>

      <ul>
         <li>Each team must have a file named <span class="code">run.txt</span> which tells the TAs how to run your
            program to verify you have a working GUI [1 point]
         </li>
         <li>Each team defines a GUI application that includes a <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> instance to
            see the fractal images [2 points]
         </li>
         <li>Each team's program must include a menu bar with the required menus and menu items [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's program exits the program when the exit menu item is selected [2 points]</li>

         <li>Each team's program must display the appropriate fractal when its menu item is selected [4 * 4 = 16
            points]</li>
         <li>Once a color scheme is selected, the program uses that color scheme to display all fractals [4 * 4 =
            16 points]</li>
         <li>Each team include a file named <span class="code">update.txt</span> which tells the TAs how to update
            the escape distance and verify invalid times are rejected/impossible. [1 points]
         </li>
         <li>Each team's program does not allow a user to enter an invalid escape distance or shows an error message
            and rejects the invalid escape distance [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's program accepts valid escape distance and recalculates and redraws the fractal when given a
            new escape distance [4 points]</li>
         <li>Once a new escape distance is entered, the program continues to use that time when generating other
            fractals [2 points]</li>

         <li>Each team must write JUnit tests showing that their project can: [50 points]
            <ul>
               <li>JUnit tests from phase #1 have been updated (where this is needed) so they continue to pass [26
                  points]
               <li>When the escape distance is set to 3, calculates the escape time for a coordinate whose distance
                  from the origin exceeds the escape distance after a 10 passes of the loop [4 * 6 points = 24 points]
