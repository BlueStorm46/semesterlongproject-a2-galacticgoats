      <h2 class="name">Phase Description</h2>
      <p>The third phase of the project gives you an opportunity to continue working with your codebase and
         discovering the fun resulting from all those hard-coded constants. Well-designed, well-commented code should
         make the needed changes easy; other code may learn what was meant by "<span
         style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">hours of coding makes
            up for minutes of planning</span>".
      </p>
      <p>This phase will have you update your program to provide users with three
            additional options: <span class="highlight">selecting any maximum escape time between 1 and 255</span>; <span class="highlight">zoom in on a section of the
            fractal</span>; and <span class="highlight">adding a button or menu item which resets the zoom level to the original coordinate range</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The biggest of these changes is that your program must <span class="highlight">allow users to click
            and drag the cursor in the fractal and have your program automatically zoom in on this region of the fractal</span>.
         You can <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes5/c6/s4.html">read this tutorial</a> to learn how mouse events can
         be handled within the GUI. While the cursor is being dragged through the screen, your program must provide some
         sort of visual feedback for the region they are selecting. This feedback can be by drawing a selection box, but
         could be updating a label to show the edge of the selected range or some other GUI-based approach. Once the
         user finishes dragging the cursor, your program will need to recalculate the fractal. The recalculated fractal
         should use the coordinate range the user selected, but use the same algorithm as before and still be sized 512
         pixels by 512 pixels.
      </p>
      <p>A second change is that you need to provide the user with some way of having the system recalculate and
         redisplay the fractal using the default coordinate range. When the user chooses your option, <span
         class="highlight">only reset the zoom and NOT the algorithm or coloring</span>. You can use a button, menu
         item, or some other GUI approach to have this reset work. Whatever approach you choose, make certain you create
         a document named <span class="code">reset.txt</span>. Your <span class="code">reset.txt</span> document should
         tell the TA what they should do to use your reset option.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, we are doing away with nearly all constants in our escape time algorithm (constants in the update
         steps cannot change). <span class="highlight">Provide the user with methods to change both the maximum
            escape time and escape distance</span>. However you choose to do this, make certain you create a document, named <span
         class="code">update.txt</span> that includes instructions so the TAs can test changing the escape distance and
         max. escape time. Your program must either prevent users from entering an invalid max escape time OR show an
         error when the max escape time they enter is not an integer between 1 - 255. If the user provides a valid max
         escape time greater than 0, recalculate the last chosen fractal and have the <span class="code">FractalPanel</span>
         display the recalculated escape times.
      </p>
      <p>Remember, <span style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">hours
            of coding makes up for minutes of planning</span>.

   <div class="section">
      <a name="submit"></a>
      <h2 class="name">How to Submit</h2>
      <p>Phase #3 should be submitted by the team member whose UBIT username comes first alphabetically. If that student is not available,
      another student can submit the assignment.
      We <b>strongly</b>
         encourage each team schedule a meeting which includes all members to do the Web-CAT submission. <span
         class="highlight">Any students not included in the list of submission group members will
            receive a 0.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The project submission must contain the entire Eclipse project including the properly Javadoc'd source
         code. This includes both the implementation code AND the JUnit test code.</p>

      <h2 class="name">Phase #3 Grading Rubric</h2>
      <p>The team grades for phase #3 will use the following rubric:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Each team's submission includes a file named <span class="code">run.txt</span> which tells the TAs how
            to run your program to verify you have a working GUI [1 point]
         </li>
         <li>Each team defines a GUI application that includes a <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> instance to
            see the fractals [2 points]
         </li>
         <li>Each team's program includes the required menu bar, menus, and menu items [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's program correctly handles when the user selects one of the menu items [5 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's program correctly generates all four of the fractals and creates all four of their color
            schemes [5 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's submission includes a file named <span class="code">reset.txt</span> which tells the TAs
            how to reset the zoom so that the fractal is redrawn using the original coordinate range [1 point]
         </li>
         <li>Each team's submission includes a GUI-based approach to reset the zoom in a fractal [2 points]</li>
         <li>Once zoom reset is selected, the fractal is redrawn using the original coordinate range [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's submission includes a file named <span class="code">update.txt</span> which tells the TAs
            how to update the escape distance and also tells the TA how to update the maximum escape time [1 point]
         </li>
         <li>Each team's submission includes a GUI-based approach to update the escape distance and to update the maximum escape
            time [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's program accepts valid escape distances and maximum escape times and recalculates and
            redraws the fractal when the user specifies a new value [4 points]</li>
         <li>Once a new escape distance is entered and once a new maximum escape time is entered, the program
            continues to use that value when calculating fractals [2 points]</li>
         <li>Each team's submission allows users to select a portion of a fractal to zoom in on [4 points]</li>
         <li>While a user is dragging the mouse to select the region of the fractal on which to zoom in, the program provides some visual feedback for their actions [5 points]</li>
         <li>Once a region is selected, the program recalculates and redisplays a 512-by-512 fractal only showing the selected coordinates [10 points]</li> 
         <li>Each team must write JUnit tests showing that their project can: [50 points]
            <ul>
               <li>JUnit tests from phases #1 and 2 have been updated (where this is needed) so they continue to pass [26
                  points]</li>
               <li>When the maximum escape time is set to 135 and the escape distance is set to 2, calculates the escape time for a coordinate whose distance from the origin never exceeds the escape distance [4 * 6 points = 24 points]
               <ul>
                     <li>Mandelbrot Set: (0.3207031250000001, -0.07109374999999386)</li>
