      <h2 class="name">Phase Description</h2>
      <p>The final phase of the project gives you an opportunity to continue working with your codebase and
         discovering the fun of hard-coded constants. In addition, this phase will give you an opportunity to learn how software
         can split work into multiple independent tasks (multi-threading) which allows it to use all of a processor's cores and complete the job faster. 
         Well-designed, well-commented code should make it easy to make these changes; others may continue learning what was meant by "<span
         style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://bit.ly/2oBWu3I">hours of coding makes
            up for minutes of planning</a></span>".
      </p>
      <p>This phase will have you update your program in four different ways: <span class="highlight">update your code so that it calculates and display fractals that are 2048 x 2048 pixels</span> (for this to display correctly, you must also you set the <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> instance's size to 2048 x 2048);
      <span class="highlight">adding a button or menu item which allows the user to specify the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/8/6/f/4/8/21866-Multi-core_Programming_Basic_Concepts.ppt">number of threads</a> used to calculate the fractal</span>;  and
      <span class="highlight">use the <span class="code">ComputePool</span> class I provide to enable calculating the fractal in parallel</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The biggest of these changes is that your program will need to make changes so that <span class="highlight">it can use multiple threads
      to calculate each fractal</span>. Getting multithreading details correct, especially in Swing, is incredibly difficult. Your project must
      use the <span class="code">ComputePool</span> (and the related <span class="code">WorkerResult</span> class) which will take care of these details.
      You should <a href="FractalThreading.jar">download the JAR file containing these classes</a> and add this to your project. The <span class="code">ComputePool</span> includes 3 methods that you may want to use:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><span class="code" style="color: blue;">changePanel(FractalPanel fp)</span> -- specifies the instance of <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> that will be updated whenever
      a fractal finished being generated</li>
            <li><span class="code" style="color: blue;">clearPool()</span> -- cancels any on-going calculates and resets the <span class="code">ComputePool</span>'s state so that it is ready to calculate a new fractal</li>
            <li><span class="code" style="color: blue;">generateFractal(int rows, SwingWorker&lt;WorkerResult, Void&gt;[] instances)</span> -- starts the process of calculating a fractal which will have the specified number of rows and
            will be generated by the objects in the array. For this to work, the <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> instances <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be newly allocated and have started executing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For this to work with your code, you will need to provide it with a subclass of <span class="code">SwingWorker</span>. This is a class that Java designed to allow work to occur in the
      background, but then have the results made available safely inside a Swing application. To do this, the <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> subclass does all of its processing in a overriden <span class="code">doInBackground()</span> method and returns the final result.
      Whether you want to create a new subclass or make one of your existing classes a subclass of <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> is up to your group to decide. Your program will need to pass an array with an instance of your <span class="code">SwingWorker</span>
      for each thread. Calculating results should be split as equally as possible along the rows of the fractal. Each <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> instance will need to calculate the escape times for all of the pixels in the range of rows it is assigned.
      Once this is complete, it will need to return a <span class="code">WorkerResult</span> instance with its results. The <span class="code">ComputePool</span> instance automatically detects when each worker finishes and will update the fractal once all of the work is done.</p> 
      <p>A second change takes advantage of the increase in fractal generation speed that this parallelism provides. The final remaining constant in our escape time algorithm --
      the size of the fractal -- is changing. With this phase, <span class="highlight">your program should calculate a 2048 x 2048 pixel fractal. To take advantage of this increased detail, you should also
      set the <span class="code">FractalPanel</span> instance's size to 2048 x 2048</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the optimal number of threads depends on a huge number of factors. There are not any easy ways to find and update this number,
      so we will not even try. Instead, <span class="highlight">provide the user with some way of entering how many <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> instances should
      be used generating fractals in the future</span>. However you choose to do this, 
      create a document, named <span
         class="code">workers.txt</span> that explains how the TAs can test changing the number of <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> instances
         used to calculate fractals moving forward. Your program must either prevent users from 
         entering an invalid number of <span class="code">SwingWorker</span> instances  OR show an
         error when the number they enter is not an integer between 1 - 128. If the user provides a valid number
         greater than 0, make certain that all future calculations would use that number (unless this value is changed again).</p>
      <p>
      <p><span style="text-align: center; color: maroon; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">Optional (ungraded) challenges:</span> The FractalPanel class
      includes a method which allows you to save the current image to a file. While not worth any points, you could add a &quot;Save as...&quot; menu item to the File menu and save the images you find.
      Another interesting idea would be to add an &quot;easter egg&quot; for the TAs and I to find. These can be a lot of fun and a great way of advertising your programming skill to the world at large.

   <div class="section">
      <a name="recitation"></a>
      <h2 class="name">Recitation Activity for Week of Apr. 24 - Apr. 29</h2>
      <p>The second week of the phase will not have a traditional recitation activity. Instead, students will have
         nearly the full 110 minutes to work in their groups on this phase. During this time the TAs will be talking to
         each group about their plans for this phase. In particular, <span class="highlight">each group will
            explain how their program will implement having the fractal generated by a number of instances that the user previously specified</span>. While code is not required,
         <span class="highlight">explanations should include what classes are involved, how the number of instances will be specified, 
         how each instance will know which rows it is calculating, and how the escape times are calculated.
          You do not need to show any code, but we want to see
            you have planned out how this will be done</span>. Grades for the recitation will be assigned using the following
         rubric:
